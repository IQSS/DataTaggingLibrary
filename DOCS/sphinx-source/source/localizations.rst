Text Externalization and Localizations
========================================

PolicyModels offers a text externalization/localization mechanism. This mechanism can be used when decision graph questions require long texts, or when there's a need to present a model in more than one langugage. Another advantage of having the texts outside of the interview is that it allows text editing by domain experts who are not familiar with PolicyModel's syntax.

During an interview, the system will use localized texts when available, and default to the texts appearing in the policy model itself when no localized value is available. Thus, it is possible to only partially localize an interview -- useful for those times when only a few questions are too long and need to be pulled out for editing.

.. note:: Localization data are used by the web-based interview. CliRunner, being a console-based application, cannot present formatted texts.

All elements of a policy model can be localized, as detailed below. Localizations live in a special sub-directory in the model directory, called ``languages``. Each localization has its own directory. The name of the directory of a given localization should reflect the language and dialect of the localization. This can be done using codes (such as `ISO-639`_ and `ISO-3166`_).

Formats
~~~~~~~~
PolicyModel localizations make use of plan text, HTML, and -- mostly -- GitHub-flavored `markdown`_. markdown provides a good balance between rich features (such as formatting, hyperlinking and graphics) and simple syntax. Multiple visual markdown editors are available, including free, open source and web-based ones.

Localization Elements
----------------------

In this section, we look into how different parts of a model can be localized.

.. tip:: There's no need to manually create the files listed here; they can be created automatically from CliRunner by executing the command ``\loc-create``.

Model Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The textual parts of the :doc:`policy model description file<policy-model>` are localized using an XML file named ``localized-model.xml``. This file contains localizations for the title, sub-title, authors, and keywords.

Readme
~~~~~~
The readme file should contain general, free-form text about the model. The system supports three formats for a readme file: HTML, `markdown`_, and plain text. In case more than a single file is present, the file with the richer format will be displayed (e.g. given a text and a markdown file, the system will use the markdown one).


Policy Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Policy space texts are stored in a file named ``space.md``. It consists of a list of slot and value names, followed by tehir descriptive texts.

* Slot/value descriptions starts by either:

  * New line with type path, ``:`` (no spaces between line start and ``:``)
  * New line with ``# typePath`` EOL.

* Slot/value names are either full or non-ambiguous
* The localization text is markdown.
* Can have line comments (``<--``)
* Content of text for type goes all the way until next type/EOF

Below is an example of a ``space.md`` file:

.. code::

  # Base/Dogs
  This slot describes which dogs should join.

  Base/Rice: This slot will contain which type of rice is used.

  Base/Cats/Tom: Tom, a large cat that sits on fences, staring at the passing cars.

  Sox: Another cat, whose name is unique enough so that we can omit the Base/Cats part of the type path.


Answers
~~~~~~~

The ``answers.txt`` file localizes the answer names. Each line contains the answer in the decision graph and its localized name, separated by a colon.
Line-comments (``<--``) are also supported, for convenience.

.. code::

  <-- common answers
  yes: sí
  no: no
  maybe: tal vez <-- used when unsure
  <-- Support for §17.a
  biology: biología
  sociology: sociología
  other: otro


Decision Graph Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Decision graph elements that contain texts (``ask``, ``todo``, and ``section``) can be localized by adding a file to the ``nodes`` sub-directory in the localization directory. The file name is the id of the node it provides localized text for. Files can be in either text (``.txt``) or markdown (``.md``) format. In case both text and markdown files are present, the markdown variant is preferred.


.. tip:: There are many Markdown editors that offer formatted preview of the text, or even allow editing of formatted text (like "normal" word processors.) Use your favorite search engine to find one - the list updated too often to include a recommendation here.
