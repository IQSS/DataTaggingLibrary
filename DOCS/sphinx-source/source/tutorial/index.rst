PolicyModels Tutorial
=====================

This tutorial teaches how to write a model in PolicyModels. As usual, we'll start with a `hello world`_ program, and take it from there.
This tutorial uses ``CliRunner``, PolicyModel's command line execution environmnet. It can be run from a terminal or from any Java IDE.
