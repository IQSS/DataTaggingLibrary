Take PolicyModels for a Spin
=============================

To start modeling policies using PolicyModels and it's tools, you'll need PolicyModels' console application, **CliRunner**. It is available from `binaries page`_ at the DataTaggingLibrary GitHub repository. There are two .zip files
of interest in the release:

.. _binaries page: https://github.com/IQSS/DataTaggingLibrary/releases

**PolicyModels-[version_goes_here].zip**
  Contains CliRunner and required Java libraries. You need this one.
**sample-models.zip**
  Contains some sample models so it's easier to get started. This file is optional.

.. note::
   CliRunner requires Java JDK. You can freely download it from `here`_.

.. _here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

.. tip:: When coding policy models, you may want to use the `language support package`_ for the `Atom`_ text editor.

.. _Atom: https://atom.io/
.. _language support package: https://atom.io/packages/language-datatags

Download and extract the **PolicyModels-[version].zip** file. Using a terminal [*]_, naviagte to the newly extracted  directory, and type::

  java -jar DataTagsLib.jar

You should see the DataTags/PolicyModels logo, followed by a prompt. To load a policy model, such as those available from the extracted *sample-models.zip* file, type ``\load path/to/model``. To create a new model, type ``\new``. CliRunner will ask you for some data, and then create the model for you.

   The CliRunner application is a swiss-army knife tool for policy model developers

The DataTaggingLibrary comes with a command line tool for developing questionnaires. It allows for:

* Performing an interview.
* Inspecting nodes and slots.
* *Visualizations* (requires `graphviz`_)
* Run inspections - trace, stack status, tag status

  .. _graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org

While developing the questionnaire, it is useful to keep a CliRunner open. The user can reload the
questionnaire by typing ``\reload`` on the console when needed.

To start CliRunner with a specific model, pass the path to its folder as a parameter, like so::

  java -jar DataTagsLib.jar path/to/model/

.. tip :: On most systems, instead of typing the path to the model, you can just drag the model to the terminal window, which would make the terminal application type it for you.

.. tip :: For a more structured introduction, see the :doc:`tutorial/index`

.. [*] A terminal is the application used to run applications with command line interface. On Macs it's called "Terminal" and can be found in ``/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app``. In Windows, it's called "CMD" and can be opened by opening the "start" menu, navigating to "All Programs", then "Accessories", then selecting "Command Prompt" (or by typing ``cmd`` in the run dialog).
