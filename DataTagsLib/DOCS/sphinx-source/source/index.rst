The `DataTags`_ project aims to allow researchers to create proper dataset handling and sharing policies,
even if they lack the required legal and technological expertise.
The project is part of a the `Privacy Tools for Sharing Research Data`_ project. There are a few
approaches for developing such system. This site uses tag spaces to describe data handling policies,
and an imperative approach based on *decision graphs* to decide on a policy.

   The DataTags concept, as well as a previous version of the code described here,
   was presented in the paper: Sharing Sensitive Data with Confidence: The Datatags System.

A decision graph is a graph (in the mathematical sense) with different type of nodes. When the
user goes through the interview, a *Decision Graph Engine* traverses the graph. When the engine
reaches a node, it performs an instruction associated with it, such
as ``ask`` (ask the user a question) or ``set``.

Tag spaces are also described by a domain specific language.

This site documents those two languages, and some language-related tools.

.. note:: The code for this project is open source, and available at a `GitHub Repository`_. The code and this site were developed by Michael Bar-Sinai, through an affiliation with the `Institute for Quantitative Social Science`_ and the `Data Privacy Lab`_ at Harvard University, with the help of students from US REU programs and the `computer science department at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel`_.
