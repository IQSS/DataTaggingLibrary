Do the data include personally identifiable information about a student? Personally identifiable information about a student includes, but is not limited to, the following categories of information:
        * A student’s name
        * The name of a student’s parent or other family members
        * The address of a student or a student’s family
        * Other direct identifiers, defined as information that relates specifically to an individual, such as a student’s Social Security number, student number, other identifying number or code, telephone number, e-mail address, or biometric record
        * Other indirect identifiers, defined as information that can be combined with other information to identify specific individuals, such as the student’s gender, race, religion, date of birth, place of birth, other geographic indicators, height, weight, mother’s maiden name, activities, employment information, education information, financial information, and other descriptors
        * Other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty
        * Information disclosed in response to a targeted request

### Terms
* *Deidentified information*: Information that has been deidentified is considered not to contain personally identifiable information. The term deidentified is used to describe records that have enough personally identifiable information removed or obscured such that the remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. In making a determination that a student’s identity is not personally identifiable, both single and multiple data releases from the education records should be taken into account along with other information available from other sources.
* *Biometric record*: Refers to a record of one or more measurable biological or behavioral characteristics that can be used for automated recognition of an individual. Examples include fingerprints; retina and iris patterns; voiceprints; DNA sequence; facial characteristics; and handwriting.
* *Targeted request*: Refers to a request by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. For example, if there was a rumor published in the local paper that a public official was disciplined for cheating during his senior year in high school, a request to the high school for the disciplinary records of students who were caught cheating during the year the public official was a senior would be considered a targeted request.
