        * A student’s name
        * The name of a student’s parent or other family members
        * The address of a student or a student’s family

        * Information disclosed in response to a targeted request}
      {terms:
        {Deidentified information: Information that has been deidentified is considered not to contain personally identifiable information. The term deidentified is used to describe records that have enough personally identifiable information removed or obscured such that the remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. In making a determination that a student’s identity is not personally identifiable, both single and multiple data releases from the education records should be taken into account along with other information available from other sources.}
        {Biometric record: Refers to a record of one or more measurable biological or behavioral characteristics that can be used for automated recognition of an individual. Examples include fingerprints; retina and iris patterns; voiceprints; DNA sequence; facial characteristics; and handwriting.}
        {Targeted request: Refers to a request by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. For example, if there was a rumor published in the local paper that a public official was disciplined for cheating during his senior year in high school, a request to the high school for the disciplinary records of students who were caught cheating during the year the public official was a senior would be considered a targeted request.}

    {Educational agency or institution:
      An educational agency or institution is a public or private agency or institution that provides educational services or instruction, or both, to students. This includes, but is not limited to, a primary or secondary school, college or university, school district, or state department of education.}

It includes funds provided by grant, cooperative agreement, contract, subgrant, or subcontract; or funds provided to students attending the agency or institution. The funds may be paid to the institution by those students for educational purposes, such as under the Pell Grant Program and the Guaranteed Student Loan Program.

For the purposes of this questionnaire, information may satisfy this definition even if it has been deidentified.

         Examples of records directly related to a student include:

          * Directory information such as name, address, telephone listing, e-mail address, date and place of birth, dates of attendance, number of course units in which enrolled, class level, major field of student, last school attended, degrees and honors received, participation in official student activities, and student athletes’ weight and height
          * Parent’s or guardian’s name or address
          * Student identification number, Social Security number
          * Demographic information such as gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship
          * Identification photographs
          * Current academic status, class schedule, courses taken, academic specialization and activities, units attempted and completed, instructors, past academic status, official communications regarding academic status
          * Academic evaluations, including student examination papers, transcripts, grade point average, grades in courses, test scores, recorded communications that are part of the academic process, and other academic records
          * Counseling and advising records
          * Disciplinary records

          * Employment records for an educational agency or institution
          * Records produced by a physician, psychiatrist, or other professional for treatment purposes

        * A student’s name
        * The name of a student’s parent or other family members
        * The address of a student or a student’s family
        * Other direct identifiers, defined as information that relates specifically to an individual, such as a student’s Social Security number, student number, other identifying number or code, telephone number, e-mail address, or biometric record
        * Other indirect identifiers, defined as information that can be combined with other information to identify specific individuals, such as the student’s gender, race, religion, date of birth, place of birth, other geographic indicators, height, weight, mother’s maiden name, activities, employment information, education information, financial information, and other descriptors
        * Other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty
        * Information disclosed in response to a targeted request}
  {terms:
    {Deidentified information:
      Information that has been deidentified is considered not to contain personally identifiable information. The term deidentified is used to describe records that have enough personally identifiable information removed or obscured such that the remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual. In making a determination that a student’s identity is not personally identifiable, both single and multiple data releases from the education records should be taken into account along with other information available from other sources.}
    {Biometric record:
      Refers to a record of one or more measurable biological or behavioral characteristics that can be used for automated recognition of an individual. Examples include fingerprints; retina and iris patterns; voiceprints; DNA sequence; facial characteristics; and handwriting.}
    {Targeted request:
      Refers to a request by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. For example, if there was a rumor published in the local paper that a public official was disciplined for cheating during his senior year in high school, a request to the high school for the disciplinary records of students who were caught cheating during the year the public official was a senior would be considered a targeted request.}
