### Terms
* *Educational agency or institution*: An educational agency or institution is a public or private agency or institution that provides educational services or instruction, or both, to students. This includes, but is not limited to, a primary or secondary school, college or university, school district, or state department of education.
* *Funds from the US Department of Education*: This means funds provided for any purpose, research or otherwise, by the US Department of Education to the educational agency or institution. It includes funds provided by grant, cooperative agreement, contract, subgrant, or subcontract; or funds provided to students attending the agency or institution. The funds may be paid to the institution by those students for educational purposes, such as under the Pell Grant Program and the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. This includes all public schools and a majority of private institutions, though most private and parochial schools at the elementary and secondary levels do not receive such funding.
